# Introduction-to-Graph-Analytics
Project-1 Files of Introduction to data analytics course. In this project we are performing graph analytics on a data set that represents a large complex graph. 

# Dataset Details
The given dataset [soc-Epinions1_adj.tsv] is a graph of links of opinions from the SOC-E website. There are total of 811480 entries in the dataset and approximately 10 million nodes. Format of each row is <node-1>, <node-2>, # Edges. 


# Analysis
Our understanding of working with datasets and creating graphs from them—especially medium- to large-scale datasets—is improved by this study. We gained practical experience in building our own functions, using the igraph and sna packages, and utilizing R. We improved our abilities to plot and visualize graphs, simplify them, and change their parameters to make them easier to read. We obtain important insights into the structure and relationships inside the graph using the numerous graph analytics functions that are described in this project. 
We gained knowledge of key metrics for comprehending the issue space, including power centrality, greatest cliques, egos, longest paths, and alpha centrality. We also studied how random walks can be used to locate communities in a graph. We can find patterns, structures, and links in the data and create efficient methods for examining and visualizing big, intricate networks by comprehending these metrics. 
After completing this project, we can confidently work with R to generate and plot graphs, perform graph analytics on large datasets, apply various functions and measures/metrics to the graph that allow us to draw different conclusions about the graph and the problem domain, and simplify graphs for better analysis.
